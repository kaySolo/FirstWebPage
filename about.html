                    <h1>Hi, Thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
                    <p>College life is a bound free life. Here nobody is behind anybody for doing class. Nobody is there to see who is bunking and where they are. That’s why amidst all fun of bunking there lies a responsibility of every student to understand that how much loss or gain they are doing to themselves by that. Fun and sincerity should always be well balanced. One should not happen at the cost of other. Otherwise we will miss out one or both. Some people get married just after college. Some choose to do job and some go for higher studies. Everyone have their own choices.</p>
                    <p>So <b>college life</b> is a very memorable part of everyone’s scrapbook, personal diary, photo album or anything else. However it is, but it is close to the heart. If we are self-conscious, we will do both hard work and fun at a balance and thus make the most of it. Only fun will destroy us. And only responsibility will deprive us from a fun filled experience.</p>
